The PyNinjaTrader ecosystem consists of a Python script and a NinjaTrader 8 script. 
For licensing, an indicator is used. 
Documentation for connecting NinjaTrader 8 with Python using a simple drag and drop indicator.
A fully suited solution that is fully tested, fast, and efficient.

The communication between the Python script and the strategy is based on websockets.
The strategy acts as the server, and the Python script is the client.
It is always query (function/Python script) and output (data/server).
The strategy does not need to run on the same computer as the Python script.
On our GitHub link, you will find the Python script, the strategies, full documentation, and a PyNinjaTrader example script showing how to call the functions.
For questions, we also have a Discord channel.
In the demo (without the licensing indicator), you have full functionality, but for a limited number of instruments 
(EURUSD, AUDCHF, NZDCHF, GBPNZD, and USDCAD).
